I know many languages, yet no one speaks those languages. In all languages, there are some form of clearly defined rules which are used to govern the language. Programming languages are no different and may of those rules relate directly to the syntax of the language. Programming languages however have much more freedom than standard languages.

To address the huge degree of freedom in programming. Coding standards and design patterns were conceived. Having recently developed many mock websites and meteor based applications, I was able to realize first-hand design patterns. After developing the first website, I was able to use the first website as a base and slowly refine the website template.
