Sound Voltex/K-Shoot Mania is a rhythm game which originated in Japan. Motivated by the high cost of commercial gamepads, I set out to create a DIY version. For this particular revision, I decided to be liberal with the design and substitute the main buttons with 33mm buttons (original 60mm).

The current software design is built for the open-source version of SDVX, K-Shoot mania. Further designs will include persistent setting storage and gamepad modes. SDVX application will also be attempted to be ported to Debian via wine.

The source code for the firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/Reyn-Mukai/Bemani-SDVX).
